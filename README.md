This project will be based on finding similarity in the job requirement of the candidate as well as ideal candidates for the employer. This project aims to recommend, both employers and job hunters, the candidates and jobs, they will be interested in, respectively.
This phase is data acquisition phase. In parallel to that I am trying to implement the similarity algorithm using neural networks. I have accumulated a lot of data but can't share the personal information of over 100 employees and employers.

The second phase will be training my neural network and tuning the parameters to reduce biasing and avoid overfitting the data. It will not take as much time as data acquisition is the largest time eater.
